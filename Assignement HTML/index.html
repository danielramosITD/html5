	<h1>About me</h1>

I arrived in Vancouver Canada on September 23 along with my family with the desire to provide a better future for my children.

	<h2>Git Hub</h2>
	<p>GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.[3]
	GitHub offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts[4] which are commonly used to host open-source software projects.[5] As of June 2018, GitHub reports having over 28 million users[6] and 57 million repositories[7] (including 28 million public repositories[8]), making it the largest host of source code in the world.[9]
	On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced it had reached an agreement to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion.[10] The purchase closed on October 26, 2018.[11]</p>
